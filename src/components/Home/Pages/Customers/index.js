                  Pet Me Maa is the safest place for my baby üèª it is actually
                  the second home to Cooper. In today‚Äôs scenario, getting too
                  many news about animal abuse, hence it is very difficult to
                  trust any place. But luckily, we found the best and safest
                  place for Cooper. Even we also enjoy going there because of
                  great food and amazing people out there. Cooper loves you guys

                  Pet me Maa is Bella's second home now. It's luxurious for
                  pets. Food is amazing in the cafe. Good for family outing or
                  dates. Bella is a 7 months old Indian puppy. She learned how
                  to socialize with other dogs here. It's a safe and hygienic
                  place. A team of professionals including trainers, animal
                  behaviourists , animal lovers and groomers will make sure that
                  your pet remains healthy and happy all the time. The kind of
                  dedication and hardwork Priyanka and her team members are
                  putting are admirable. Would love to recommend to everyone.
                  Ample parking space is there. Big lawns, awesome food and care
                  takers. Much love to Pet me Maa and more power to the team.
